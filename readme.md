 ### Blog

The blog page is to demonstrate more of my personality with the content and the display.

- Contains AI art I generated using Dalle 3
- Mobile view displays more of a list format - a featured blog post at the top followed by blog cards
- On larger views the featured/most recent blog takes up a much larger portion of the screen and the older posts are underneath
- Each post displays a title, date and a paragraph from the blog post.
- Each post is a clickable link that will take you to the blog page.

 ### Blog Pages

The blog pages demonstage a different layout and show an image with text, displayed responsively.

- Appears as title, image, date, and text body on mobile and tablet views.  
- Desktop displays with title at the top, image to the left and text to the right.
- Images adjust in size depending on screen size
- I used one style sheet for all of the blog pages so they are all styled in the same way. Images and text would be changed in the html page. This means I can keep an html template to fill out for each new blog page without needing to change the css. This also means if I updated anything in the layout I would only be changing the one style sheet.
