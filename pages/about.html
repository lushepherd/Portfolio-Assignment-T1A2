                        <h3>Hi, I'm Lucy!</h3>
                        <p>I'm a full stack web developer based on the Gold Coast, QLD.</p>
                        <p>I decided to pursue a career in web development late 2023. Professionally, I wanted to learn how things worked and be the person fixing issues, not just reporting them. Personally, I thought it was a fun way to express my creativity in a way I felt comfortable.</p>
                        <p>This portfolio website is to demonstrate my skills as a web developer and show a bit of my personality. I have leaned into my interest in fantasy (and a bit of absurdity) with the help of AI generated art created with Dalle-3 and inspiration from my very ridiculous cats.</p>
                        <p>I have a customer service focused work history as that is where I shine. I am passionate about efficiently delivering an excellent customer experience and fostering relationships with both internal and external clients.</p>
                        <p>I have strongly developed administrative skills which have made me organised, punctual and efficient.</p>
